  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been almost seven years since a Hollow Knight DLC became one of the most anticipated sequels in the last 10 years.</p>
<p><img src="/images/plush.jpeg" alt="hornet silksong"></p>
<p>After beating the base game, i would define Silksong as team cherry reflecting how much experience they&rsquo;ve gained after hollow knight success.</p>
<p>first time playing and enjoying and big videogame full of secrets
Silksong is a game that reflects how much experience team cherry gain with hollow knight
History is most comprehensive, they really know what they want to tell us.
Sections transitions are better</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>The first few hours of the game reveals one thing: it&rsquo;s boxed in the concept of the first game, not due to its Metroidvania structure, but because Hollow Knight is its —i&rsquo;d argue— own genre. For this reason, one of the biggest challenge for TC was recreate and -ironically- innovate their insight mechanics.</p>
<p>In hollow knight, there&rsquo;s elements that already works perfectly, so instead team cherry had a challenge
about how to manage or implement these ideas without breaking the nature of the game: sharka vs cornifer
bellbeast vs the laststag
diagonal vs horizontal pogo
flees vs grubs</p>
<h2 id="silksong-adds-depth-into-hollow-knight-franchise">Silksong adds depth into Hollow knight franchise</h2>
<p>hornet voice and dialogs are important, indirectly it enforces the idea that the last protagonist is just an empty
recipee.</p>
<h2 id="the-polemic-difficulty-git-gut-or-something-more">The polemic difficulty: git gut or something more?</h2>
<p>Sometimes specific areas feels like they&rsquo;re trying to mimic trolls games like catmario or i wanna be the guy
not because it&rsquo;s that hard but troll(hunter march and bilewaters, maybe the mist)</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s moments that makes me think no all people will be able to finish the game
*bells gauntlet
<img src="/images/gauntlet.jpg" alt="Hornet"></p>
<p>some bosses feels rng, like i already learned his moveset but still loosing because luck</p>
<h2 id="memorable-moments">Memorable moments</h2>
<p>while playing, i didn&rsquo;t find any memorable boss
i think most of the &ldquo;funny&rdquo; or top moments are<br>
maybe when nostalagia hits, we&rsquo;re will talking about how hard and iconic was groal or beastfly
there&rsquo;s no something like green path</p>
