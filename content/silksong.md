## Introduction
It's been almost seven years since a Hollow Knight DLC became one of the most anticipated sequels in the last 10 years.

After beating the base game, i would define Silksong as team cherry reflecting how much experience they've gained after hollow knight success.


first time playing and enjoying and big videogame full of secrets
Silksong is a game that reflects how much experience team cherry gain with hollow knight 
History is most comprehensive, they really know what they want to tell us.
Sections transitions are better

## First impressions 

The first few hours of the game reveal one thing: it's boxed in by the concept of the first game, not due to its Metroidvania structure, but because Hollow Knight is its —i'd argue— own genre. For this reason, one of the biggest challenges for TC was recreate and -ironically- innovate the core mechanics.

bellbeast vs the laststag
diagonal vs horizontal pogo
flees vs grubs

And they did it so well that already exists debates about these characters

## How SilkSong adds depth into Hollow knight franchise
hornet voice and dialogs are important, indirectly it enforces the idea that the last protagonist is just an empty
recipee.

## The polemic difficulty: git gut or something more?

Sometimes specific areas feels like they're trying to mimic trolls games like catmario or i wanna be the guy
not because it's that hard but troll(hunter march and bilewaters, maybe the mist)

there's moments that makes me think no all people will be able to finish the game

some bosses feels rng, like i already learned his moveset but still loosing because luck

## Memorable moments
while playing, i didn't find any memorable boss
i think most of the "funny" or top moments are  
maybe when nostalagia hits, we're will talking about how hard and iconic was groal or beastfly
there's no something like green path
