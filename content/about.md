23yo almost software engineer with weird and goofy humor. Not a native English speaking trying to write coherent and comprehensives articles about my Java/Spring Framework experiments.

Plus, it’s nice to have a blog for the sake of freedom of expression — even if I don’t really have much to say. LinkedIn is so cringe for writing and expressing my ideas.
